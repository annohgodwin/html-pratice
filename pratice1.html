<p>Brentford defender Pontus Jansson, who is not in the squad today, speaking to BBC at half time: "It's never good to concede an early goal as we did but we are still in the game. It's always how you go out to prepare and stay in the game so it's a tough start. But it's only 1-0.

"You take it game by game and respect all the teams as a tough game. We have to do the same and hopefully we'll be good here.

"Right now, it is better for us to look at the front two [in the league] and hunt them down rather than look behind us. We are in a good position."</p></div>
